# Virtual-Try-On-Fashion-Product
Abdulkadir Dağlar - Berkay Caplık - Suat Deniz
1. Product Images: We will be using product images of the fashion items we want to try 
on virtually. These can be sourced from our own catalog or third-party fashion 
brands.
2. User Images: We plan to acquire images of users to try on the virtual fashion items. 
Will users upload images, or will we collect them through other means?
3. User Data: We will detail the data sources for user information, such as body 
measurements, preferences, and other relevant data that can enhance the virtual tryon experience.
4. Product Descriptions and Attributes: We will use textual data related to the fashion 
products, including descriptions, color, size, and style information.
5. User Interaction Data: If applicable, we will collect data on how users interact with 
the virtual try-on system, including user feedback, click-through rates, and session 
analytics.
6. External Datasets: We intend to use external datasets or open-source datasets 
related to fashion, human body modeling, or similar fields to enrich our training data.
7. APIs: If we intend to integrate with external services or APIs for additional data, we 
will mention which APIs we plan to use.
8. User-Generated Content: If we plan to incorporate user-generated content, such as 
reviews, social media photos, or other user-generated data, we will explain how we 
will obtain and use this data.
9. Privacy and Consent: We emphasize our commitment to privacy and data security 
and will describe how we will obtain user consent for using their images and data in 
our virtual try-on system.
10. Data Licensing: We will specify any licensing agreements or permissions we have for 
using the data, especially if we are using third-party images or data.
